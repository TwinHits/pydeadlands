The PLAN:
	1) Build random character generator
	2) 

	Edges
	Hinderances	

Ideas:
	1) User driven character creator
	2) Edges and hinderances could be sorted by what they affect, so adding
	edges and hinderences only requires coding in the edges/hinderances files
	Then each action checks for edges and hindereances that might affect it


	In order to know where to go next, I need to know what the final product
will look like.

	A deadlands library and engine that players can use in their own games.
	
	Combat engine: 
	instance of engine
	combat as a class
		turn order
		active character
	

	Combat requires that characters have location
